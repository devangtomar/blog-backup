Are you tired of the bland and uninspiring color schemes that come standard with your code editor? Do you want to add a little pizzazz to your programming environment? Well, I was in the same boat, which is why I decided to create my own VScode theme extension. And let me tell you, the experience was both challenging and rewarding.

First, I had to choose a name for my theme. After brainstorming for what felt like an eternity, I finally settled on “[**Diverse Dye**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DevangTomar.vscode-diverse-dye)”. It had a nice ring to it, and it fit the colorful vibe I was going for. **AND YES, IT’S A DARK THEME!** (well mostly)

#### Here’s the theme extension 💁🏻‍♀️

**PS :** Rate 5 ⭐😼

Next, it was time to choose the color scheme. This was a bit overwhelming at first, but I decided to go with a mix of bright hues and subtle pastels. Think sunset over the ocean, with a hint of cotton candy. 🌅🌊🍭

Once I had my color scheme in place, it was time to start coding. As someone who’s relatively new to the world of coding, I was a bit nervous about this part. But with a little trial and error, and some help from the good folks at Stack Overflow, I managed to piece together a functional and visually appealing theme.

Of course, there were some setbacks along the way. At one point, I accidentally deleted half of my code and had to start from scratch. 😱 But I persevered, and in the end, it was worth it.

Finally, it was time to share my creation with the world. I submitted my extension to the VScode marketplace, and after a brief review process, it was accepted and published! It was a proud moment, and seeing other developers download and use my theme was a great feeling.
